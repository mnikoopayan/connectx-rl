# ConnectX RL Project

This repository contains a Reinforcement Learning (RL) project for the ConnectX game, leveraging advanced techniques to train an AI agent to play optimally.

## Contents

- `connectx_rl_project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full training and evaluation workflow.
- `connectx_rl_project.html`: HTML export of the notebook for quick preview.

## Features

- Implements **Dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN)** architecture.
- Uses Kaggle's **ConnectX environment** for agent training and testing.
- Visualizes performance metrics and evaluation results.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mnikoopayan/connectx-rl.git
   cd connectx-rl
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (connectx_rl_project.ipynb) to view or run the code.
3. Submit the trained agent to Kaggle competitions using the provided files.

## Project Highlights

-Efficient RL implementation with state-of-the-art techniques.
-Detailed visualizations of training loss, win rates, and evaluation results.
-Easy integration with Kaggle's ConnectX competition.
